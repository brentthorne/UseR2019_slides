# UseR2019_slides
Here are the slides used for my lightning talk at the UseR! 2019 conference in Toulouse.

Please see https://brentthorne.github.io/UseR2019_slides/#1 for a live version of the slides. There will also (soon hopefully) be a video of the talk posted on the [R Consortium YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_R5smHVXRYGhZYDJsnXTwg) and I suggest waiting for the talk to be released before really looking too much at these slides which were not meant to be used individually from the actual talk I gave :smile:! 

**Title**<br>
Transitioning between various RMarkdown packages for workflow optimization in academic research; a graduate student's perspective.

**Abstsract**<br>
Reproducible documentation and the use of RMarkdown is becoming more prevalent in the academic world. Packages built on RMarkdown such as posterdown, xaringan, pagedown, and rticles allow for most aspects of a typical research project to be produced; however, newcomers to RMarkdown can be put off or discouraged by the inconsistencies in which each type of document needs to be formatted in the '.Rmd' file. This talk will provide insight into the benefits and downfalls of fully customizable RMarkdown packages with emphasis on (1) the importance of a timely workflow for the short duration of an average graduate student program; (2) introducing students or supervisors who are new to RMarkdown, and (3) show the importance of reproducibility in every stage of a good research project. Concepts from this presentation intend to spark conversation and show the importance of reproducible document generation in all stages of a research project.
