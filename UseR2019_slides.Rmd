**Email** - brentthorne18@gmail.com <br>

**Quick Facts:**<br>
- Started using R in 2014
- Hated it!
- Realized the value in FOSS
- Taught myself R 
- Made the {posterdown} package
- Now known as the "you can do that in R!" guy in my lab!

- Show them, don't tell them

- Show them only 1 item at a time

- Ask them if they want help getting started

- Can be difficult to transition between the two.

<br>
- Often a person sticks with what they started with.

- New user's are put off when needing to change what they know for little gain.

<br>

- I made `posterdown` to ensure a document written in `rmarkdown` could be immediately turned into a conference poster.

# Why should supervisors care?

<br>

1) Version control<br>

2) Reproducible

3) More time for the important stuff, think of all the manuscripts!

4) Check up on progress from a distance....

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="70%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/githubcont.png")
```

5) No need to track down a student years after they're gone for data/ analysis.

# Conclusion

- R markdown and other down packages are changing the way academia can become more streamlined for graduate students

- When creating new packages/ templates for the downverse it will be important to consider how a template may be transitioned to or from by simplifying the syntax.

- Let's encourage all levels of academia to embrace reproducible research!

# Thank you

Thank you to useR! 2019 for providing a scholarship for me to attend this years meeting!
